# Content standards

## Source-grounded generation

- All facts must come from vetted excerpts/transcripts stored in the database.
- The generator rejects worksheets if citations are missing or invalid.
- Admins must add vetted sources before generating content.

## Allowed sources

- Secular only in V1.
- No scraped content; manual vetting required.
- Store transcripts for videos whenever possible.

## Quality checks

- Each worksheet question stores citation IDs.
- Parent notes use the same citation rules.
