# Admin guide

## Resource vetting workflow

1. Add a new resource in the admin dashboard.
2. Paste transcript or excerpt text.
3. Mark the resource as approved once vetted.
4. Only approved resources are eligible for unit generation.

## Science updates

Science updates are scaffolded for a future "New in Science" module. Admins can save draft entries now. The feature flag is off in V1.
